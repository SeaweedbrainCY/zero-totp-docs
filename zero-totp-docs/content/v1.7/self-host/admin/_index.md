During the whole life of your Zero-TOTP instance, you will need to perform some administrative tasks. This page will help you to perform these tasks.

Among the task you might need to perform, you will find:
- Database backup and restore (**database backup is more than heavily recommended !**)
- Database migration (when upgrading Zero-TOTP version)
